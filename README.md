What we used to build this app:
    PERN (Postgres, Express, React, Node.js)
    Axios
    Client (Vercel), Server (Render), Database (Supabase)

Log In (IMPORTANT):
    - We are using the hobby account of Render. "Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more." is a statement by Render
    - If you are unable to log in (no response by the webpage), please be patient and wait for up to a few minutes. We apologise for any inconvenience

Features:
    - Events (that are under YOUR account/calendar), can be dragged and dropped into a new date. Where you dropped the event will be the new start date of the event, regardless of which part of the event you picked up.
    - Events can be added. You must indicate the Event Name, Description, Location, Start Time (Date and Time), end Time (Date and Time), Repeat, Calendar
    - If you specify repeat, the Start time and End Time should be the same (Time can be different), because repeat will provide its own "Repeat until when"
    - To delete an event, click on "Modify Event" and scroll to see the "Delete" option
    - To modify an event, click on "Modify Event" and scroll to see the "Save" option (after changing your variables)
    - In the Left Panel, you will see 3 tabs : Calendars, Accounts, Events
        + Calendars allow you to add new calendars, and toggle the calendars on and off to view them on your calendar
